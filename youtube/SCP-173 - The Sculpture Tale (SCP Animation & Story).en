1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:06,290
We were a team…despite our differences,
in spite of the terrible things they’d done,

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,390
we were still a team.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,160
That’s not how the higher-ups saw it, though..

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,339
No, the guys upstairs with their perfectly
pressed shirts… for them, we were judged

5
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:23,119
by our level of expendability and they knew
that our next mission... was a death sentence.

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,089
One by one that… that thing, took out my
team, my friends.

7
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:33,340
Snapping their necks so quickly and with such
ease that no sooner did I hear the scream...

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,240
they were dead.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,350
We had been used…I’d been used.

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,270
Delivered as prey to the predator, a plot
that was sanctioned by the bosses and approved

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,019
with a blood-red stamp.

12
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:48,219
Why did they do it?

13
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,300
I’m still trying to figure that out.

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,739
Maybe that’s something you can tell me after
you hear how these so-called scientific men

15
00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:02,000
left us in the cell, and in the hands, of
SCP-173.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,680
For me it had been the best of times before
it became the worst of times.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,580
The best, because I’d quickly risen through
the ranks at the facility…the worst because,

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,060
well, I’ll get to that.

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,690
I was never the best student.

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,370
I’d finished high-school by the skin of
my teeth, and my job prospects looked bleak.

21
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,930
But I was lucky I guess…

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,601
Or at least I thought so at the time.

23
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:28,270
You see I have an Uncle Siegfried who did
some work for the government.

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,910
I never actually knew what he did, just that
it was secretive work.

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,830
I used to imagine he was some sort of super
spy so you can imagine how excited I was when

26
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,820
he found out I needed a job and he offered
to help me out.

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,570
I couldn’t believe it, I always thought
he hated me.

28
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,140
I’d overheard him telling my parents that
I was a no good deadbeat but now he’d had

29
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,170
a change of heart and was willing to take
me under his wing.

30
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,500
What would I get to do?

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,700
Undercover intelligence gathering?

32
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,470
International assassinations?

33
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,310
“Just you wait,” he said.

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,740
And that’s how I found myself walking into
a sprawling, futuristic-looking facility where

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,260
they handed me a level one security clearance
card with big bold letters that read…

36
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,260
Janitor.

37
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,580
But I was happy, just the words “security
clearance” made me feel important and it

38
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,030
beat flipping burgers.

39
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:23,100
I pushed mops, turned off lights, fired-up
generators, clocked in and clocked out, but

40
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,790
all that time they must have been watching
me, grooming me, waiting for the day they

41
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,200
could throw me to the wolves.

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,160
I should have known; I’ve always been an
expendable kind of guy.

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,840
After a few years I was called to an office,
and there was a man in a plaid shirt and kind

44
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,340
of tweed jacket professors wear.

45
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,080
He asked me, “Do you have any idea about
what we actually do here?”

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,160
And to be honest, I didn’t.

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,370
I knew that there were many parts of the facility
I couldn’t enter.

48
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,440
I imagined that down the maze of corridors
were weapons being built, or prisoners being

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,520
interrogated, but I had no idea about the
anomalies.

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,230
How could I?

51
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,160
Before I was told anything I had to sign a
bunch of forms…there were so many I thought

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,140
I’d get to find out who really killed JFK.

53
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,310
And while they didn’t come out and say it,
what I inferred was that if I ever talk about

54
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,250
what happens at the facility to someone outside
the facility, well let’s just say it’s

55
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,250
not the kind of thing they’d spell out on
a piece of paper but it involves padded cells

56
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,870
and rusty tools.

57
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,590
I wasn’t scared though.

58
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,290
I was a part of something big, something secret,
and I loved it.

59
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,480
So I signed my life away with no hesitation.

60
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,600
Soon after I was introduced to my first anomaly,
the “Safe” class of course.

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,610
They took me to an observation room and from
that room I could see into another room with

62
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,500
a sign on the wall that read, “SCP-067.”

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,250
I just stood there, waiting for something
to happen, when in walked another guy in a

64
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,250
white lab coat.

65
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,230
“Welcome to your first anomaly,” he said.

66
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,170
“Is it okay if I hook you up to this heart
monitor?

67
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,100
We want to gauge your reaction to what you
see.”

68
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,590
“All I can see,” I told him, “Is an
empty room with a table and what looks like

69
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,290
a pen on top of some papers.”

70
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:12,770
“Correct,” he said, half-smiling as if
I was some kind of idiot, “That’s SCP-067.”

71
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,979
I thought about telling him that if I needed
years of training before I could see a pen

72
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:18,930
then I probably should have taken that fast
food job.

73
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,979
I could have been shift manager by now.

74
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,850
They then brought a young chimpanzee into
the room, small enough to be harmless.

75
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,289
One of the guys forced a pen into the scared
chimp’s hand and something strange happened…

76
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,419
it started scribbling.

77
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:35,710
Nonsense at first, but suddenly it was sketching
and drawing, faster and faster, I could catch

78
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,439
glimpses of words and images.

79
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,520
By the time they dragged it out it was flailing
around like it was possessed.

80
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,970
“That pen has power” said the man in the
lab coat, “a power whose source or origin

81
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,560
we don’t fully understand.

82
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,770
That’s why we’re here.

83
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,389
That’s why you are here.”

84
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,009
One of the guys in the other room held the
chimp’s drawing up to the window.

85
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:58,409
It was a perfect sketch of the Tower of London,
intricate and brilliant.

86
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:03,199
Above the sketch was the title, “Tower of
London: Tudor Period, circa 1541, the year

87
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,279
Margaret Pole, the Countess of Salisbury,
lost her head on the chopping block.”

88
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:14,419
Underneath that the chimp had written, “Pity...she
was no traitor, take it from me, I was there.”

89
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,389
They didn’t need to look at the heart rate
monitor to see that I was shocked.

90
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,460
That was far from the only anomaly I’d come
into contact with, and I must have been doing

91
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,699
something right because in time I went from
level 1, to 2, to level 3 security clearance,

92
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,669
and that’s when they made me a “Containment
Specialist.”

93
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:36,150
I won’t bore you with all the details, but
as you can guess, I dealt with the containment

94
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,150
of anomalies.

95
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,879
A lot of my time was spent looking through
small windows in cell doors, making sure that

96
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,840
whatever was inside was still inside and still
in one piece.

97
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,229
Other times I worked with field agents when
anomalies were brought in, a transition period

98
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,349
that the arrested freaks didn’t much like.

99
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:57,550
There was one certain anomaly though, that
I was tasked to oversee on many occasions.

100
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,490
I liked to think of it as my pet, but in hindsight,
I was its pet.

101
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:10,960
This was SCP-173, something that was in what
we call the Euclid class, a classification

102
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,819
meaning that we don’t fully understand it,
but know is very dangerous.

103
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:21,199
We know it’s intelligent, we know it’s
unpredictable... and we know it will kill.

104
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,719
And for that reason, there’s people tasked
with containing it and keeping an eye on it

105
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,210
at all times.

106
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,479
At first glance, you wouldn’t guess just
how dangerous 173 is.

107
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,070
You wouldn’t think it’s incredibly intelligent…
in fact you’d probably think the opposite.

108
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,830
That’s because it’s more or less a walking
slab of concrete and rebar with stunted limbs

109
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,400
and traces of spray paint that give the impression
of a dopey face.

110
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,550
We have to enter its cell twice a week for
cleaning duties.

111
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,360
It leaves a disgusting, foul smelling liquid
on the floor, a reddish brown substance that

112
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,360
I can only describe as a mix of blood and
waste products.

113
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,569
Where that stuff comes from has remained a
mystery since we first contained it in 1993.

114
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:05,770
Going into the cell was always a three man
job because, and this is maybe the weirdest

115
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,919
part about 173, it can’t move if human eyes
are watching it.

116
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,830
That’s why you need at least two people
watching it at all times.

117
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,809
If you were in the room watching 173 by yourself
and blinked you’d be dead before your eyes

118
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:18,809
opened.

119
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:22,539
We don’t know how it moves that fast but
in that fraction of a second of a second your

120
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:25,419
neck is snapped so hard it’s almost like
being decapitated.

121
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,490
I’ve seen the videos to prove it.

122
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,460
All it took was a sneeze.

123
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,649
He wasn’t even finished getting the rest
of the ACHOO out when there was a flash and

124
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:38,599
his partner was left lying on the ground,
his head twisted around the wrong direction.

125
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,960
So, you can understand why we now require
three men for any time we must enter 173’s

126
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
cell.

127
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,499
Then a few months ago I was told that a long
process would begin to train and reeducate

128
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:51,719
some future Class Ds.

129
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:56,729
Class Ds are mostly prisoners with life-long
sentences or those we’ve taken from death

130
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:58,569
row and given a new lease on life.

131
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:03,060
We were apparently understaffed, so why not
employ men whose lives had pretty much ended

132
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,060
anyway?

133
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,969
That was the rationale, or at least that’s
what they told me.

134
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:12,069
I was to train them on their new job... mopping
up 173’s mess, so that me and the rest of

135
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,039
the containment specialists could focus on
more important tasks.

136
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,289
They hadn’t been through the training I
had, seen what I had seen, but after showing

137
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:24,810
them the video of 173 nearly taking off a
man’s head they were more than willing to

138
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,080
follow the rules.

139
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,309
They understood not to blink, or turn away,
or sneeze, and that any lapse in focus could

140
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:33,300
lead to a violent death.

141
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,510
So I started to show them the ropes, how we
move as a team into the cell and always keep

142
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,060
the others informed on what we’re doing.

143
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,320
173 was always sitting in the corner of the
cell, no expression on that crude face, but

144
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,959
when we walked in its cell I got the feeling
it knew something had changed.

145
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,009
I felt almost as if it was communicating with
me, but I couldn’t tell what it was trying

146
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:55,050
to say.

147
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,009
And then it happened.

148
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:02,019
It was a Tuesday afternoon, three days from
the last time we’d cleaned.

149
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,080
As usual, 173 had covered the floor with that
horrible liquid.

150
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,560
We headed in to clean, my new team alert as
always, and some of them cleaned while others

151
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,750
kept their eyes focused on the thing in the
corner.

152
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,579
Things were going smoothly when we heard a
noise I knew very well.

153
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:20,620
It was the sound of the cell door locking.

154
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,750
Someone must have screwed up.

155
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,399
“Hey guys, we’re locked in here,” I
shouted through the intercom.

156
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,399
Nothing.

157
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,269
“Guys, the damn door is locked.”

158
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,269
Nothing.

159
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,370
I lost it a bit.

160
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,910
“Open the door, will you!”

161
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,910
Nothing.

162
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:41,050
My team looked at me, the ones not on eye
contact duty that is, as if I should know

163
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,839
what to do…hoping that this had happened
before and that there was some kind of standard

164
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:46,529
plan to deal with it.

165
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:48,060
There wasn’t.

166
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,870
We were always observed when in the room and
I knew that a technician couldn’t accidentally

167
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,880
lock the door.

168
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,029
It was impossible.

169
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:56,160
There were protocols.

170
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,230
Someone had done this on purpose.

171
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,740
The four of us sat in the corner of the room
as far from 173 as possible, our eyes locked

172
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
on it.

173
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,620
It didn’t move an inch as usual, just stood,
staring at the wall as it always did.

174
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,779
We stayed awake through the night, talking
a little, holding on to the slim hope that

175
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,870
something had gone wrong.

176
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,079
But as night turned to day again we all began
to lose hope.

177
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,610
We weren’t sent here to clean.

178
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,380
We were a test… totally expendable… lab
rats.

179
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,000
But I wouldn’t go down without a fight.

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,690
We couldn’t just stay up forever, that was
a death sentence.

181
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,000
I suggested that two of us stand, one sit
and rest, and one get some sleep.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,250
We’d take shifts.

183
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,000
A couple hours on, a couple hours off, maybe
if we could show that we wouldn’t give up

184
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,980
they’d have time to realize what they were
doing was insane, call off the test, and come

185
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
free us.

186
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,399
We made it through a couple of shifts like
this and it seemed like we’d actually be

187
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,680
able to make it another day or two when everything
went wrong.

188
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,420
It was my turn to sit and rest when I heard
the worst possible noise… snoring.

189
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,200
The con next to me was sleeping quietly so
it must be one of the standers.

190
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,720
I glanced over for just a split second and
saw both of them, leaning against the cell

191
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
wall, dozing.

192
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,570
At the same time I saw the flash.

193
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,050
Crack, snap, pop.

194
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,740
One after another their necks were snapped.

195
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,949
I’m not sure how it happened but I was standing
again, staring at 173 who was now in the corner,

196
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:26,620
dead bodies with their heads twisted around
piled up in front of it.

197
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,180
I couldn’t take it anymore, I couldn’t
stare at this thing forever, I felt myself

198
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,180
giving up.

199
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:38,640
I lowered my head to the ground and then finally
broke my gaze, ready to die.

200
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,649
And then… nothing happened.

201
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:46,110
I slowly raised my head back up and -
There it was, it’s hideous face inches away

202
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,110
from mine.

203
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,230
It was then that I understood what we’d
been containing, what we’d underestimated.

204
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,360
I felt again like it was telling me something.

205
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,529
It was telling me to close my eyes, to sleep.

206
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,720
So I did.

207
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,450
But as my eyes closed I didn’t see darkness,
I saw 173, or something like it.

208
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:15,060
But not in the cell, I saw it outside, in
the world, standing over children sleeping

209
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,009
in their beds, watching.

210
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:21,980
I saw them hiding in the shadows, staring
out at passers by.

211
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,430
Then I realized they weren’t watching, waiting
to pounce.

212
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,259
No, they were hiding.

213
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:34,160
My eyes popped open as the door opened and
in rushed six security personnel.

214
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,510
They took me outside, jabbed my leg with a
syringe injecting me with something as the

215
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,529
world faded away…

216
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,709
Incident Report.

217
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,040
Time and date redacted.

218
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,381
Following the experimental forced interaction
with Euclid Class anomaly SCP-173, subject

219
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:55,139
has ceased responding to external stimuli
and appears to have taken on the traits and

220
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,939
behaviors of the anomaly.

221
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:00,910
Subject now spends entire day sitting in corner
of cell staring at wall.

222
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,509
Staff are advised to proceed with caution
when dealing with subject as the only behavior

223
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:08,199
they engage in is an attempt to strangle anyone
who enters the cell.

224
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:12,470
No treatments have shown any effectiveness
and subject will unfortunately require incarceration,

225
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,089
likely forever.

226
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:19,319
