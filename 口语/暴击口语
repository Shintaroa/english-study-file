what would be your perfect day?
what/who/where would be  = what is/are
where would be your preferred location
what would be your worst nightmare?

I meant... 重解释之前的意图

That`s how I want most of my days and life to be just like that.
That`s how I want + n. + to + v.
That`s how I want my boyfriend to look like.
That`s how I want + to + v.
That`s how I want to live my life = That`s how I want my life to be lived.
That`s how I want/feel/think

what would be your perfect day? = what would that perfect day be like for you? = what would your perfect day be? = what are your perfect day?
what would be your worst nightmare? = what would your worst nightmare be?
