Wind,Courage,And Wings

isn`t it obvious?You gotta have a gliding license to legally gild in Mondstadt. 所以g=f? fly = glide吗

but Traveler and Paimon have been gliding for age now.This is first we`ve heared about it.

so You came looking for us because you wanna give us a gliding license.

No way.the knight of f have strict rules

You need to pass exam.and only then will be issue your license

Today I`m here as an examer,to oversee(监督) Travler`s official gliding exam.

I gave your wind glider so this is my responsibility at least(至少),that was Acting Grand Master Jean would say

An exam!What a pain in the butt(butt笑柄 What a pain in the butt这是一个俚语真讨厌).Then again,since Amber is the examer

Maybe you can cut me some slack.(这里cut me some slack是俚语 放我一马，通融一下)

No with a capital n-o

I mean The whole city saw how well you flew the day that Stormterror attacked,so I`m sure you will no problem.

But we do need to respect the rules and glide properly

Here,take a guild maunal.No need to mermorize it,just be familiar with everything in there

For example:only one person per wind glider, no carrying anything over the weight limit,no taking off(take off起飞,脱掉) using an Anemo(希腊语风) 
Slime,and so on (and so on 等等；诸如此类)and so forth(and so forth 等等).

Anyway,be sure to read it,okey?I had to read a load of big thick books too when Lisa was teaching me magic

Wow,that`s a big old book.. Paimon thinks we best get started.

Great,come find me when you`re done.I`ll be at Windrise.
