英语两大基本原则简洁精确
lesson 1 英语句子结构
	s-主 v-谓语 o-宾语 c-补语
	英语结构一共5种(简洁,精确)
	1.s+v(vi)
		teemo goes
		teemo goes to the field v后面是状语
		zed kills teemo solely solely是状语 副词修饰kill
		主谓结构最难的点在于为什么是不及物动词
		动作的发出者不需要任何人帮助他
	2.s+v(vt)+o
		I eat (?)
	3.s+v+o+o 主谓双宾 直宾 间宾 主谓双宾可以换位置
		I give you (?)
		I give you a rose => I give a rose to you
	4.s+v+o+c 主谓宾补
		I found China great! 只有i found China是错误的因为China本身就存在 great作为补语修饰China
		I found [that China is great!] 宾语从句
	5.s+v+c 主系表也叫主谓补 补语补主语
		China is great
		系动词有: is am are feel smell taste seem appear look等
		之前的所有英语结构中的动词都有意思 而所有的系动词都只有一个意思 是
		只要能翻译成是或者能替换成is 那就是系动词
		The dog seems ill => The dog is ill
		You look good => You are good
		The soap tastes great => The soap is great
		Zed is a ninja
		Ezreal is handsome 注意handsome d不发音 d叫爆破音 而s为摩擦音 两者在一起只能留一个 adc(attack damage carrier)
		表语是中国人自己创的词 因为最后的位置可以放n.也可以放abj.所以摸不着头脑
		a big tree => The tree is big
		a lemon tree => The tree is a lemon tree 一个名词也可以修饰名词
		所以补语也可以用名词
	根据动词判断结构 所以动词非常重要	
		I call him a dog s+v+o+c
		I give him a dog => i give a dog to him s+v+o+o
		

lesson 2 n. 名词其实就是限定词 + abj. + n.
	名词在句子中不能裸奔
	任何n都看作名词短语
		限定词 + abj. + n.
	任何部分都能省略
		a new book => a book
		the best answer => the best 举例:of these answers,this one is the best
		those sweet rose => those 举例: I want those!
	名词变成复数或者抽象时可以省略限定词 abj.完全可以不要 只是加强描述
		honesty is good honesty诚实是抽象的无需限定词
		water(food) is cold 无法根据表面分析多少可以不加限定词
	英语很多时候要灵通所谓的可数不可数其实根本没这个概念 
		seven waters古代欧洲对世界海洋的认识七大洋
		person的复数不是people 比如在电梯里capacity 30 persons 这里的30 persons 代表30个个体
		people这个单词表示民族的时候就可以用peoples
	the定冠词 the 是 that those的弱化
		I want a book
		I have finished the book you lent me
		用the是有指定的
		he is at home
		I saw a light in his house
		turn off the portal light 门廊灯 因为门廊灯只有一盏是有指定的
		I`m going to the office now
		Do you mind if i open a/the window.a the都可以 the代表的是指定附近的窗户
	专有n. 人名 地名 坚决不加the
		Sunday是专有名词
		There are five sundays this month
		I have a meeting on sunday this week 在这一周中只有一个周日所以没有限定词
		Sun Wukong is king of monkeys 因为孙悟空只有一个而猴子王只有一个所以变为了专有名词
		Jarvan IV is a better king than his father.
		Garen is a member of the Demacia.
		Jarvan named Garen Might of Demacia 嘉文任命盖伦为德玛西亚之力 德玛西亚之力就是专有名词
		Garen,Might of Demcia kills Teemo
	加了冠词就理解为the book => that/those book
		This is not the Teemo I killed. 这里就不是专有名词因为匹配模式可能有两个提莫
	例外(?)
		the Pacific 太平洋
		the Atlantic 大西洋
		看上去像专有名词但他们不是 因为他们省略了 ocean the限定的是ocean 英语要简洁清楚pacific后面很少是其他东西
		而the indian ocean 不能省略ocean 因为the indian就变成了印度人
		the dead sea不能略sea 如果略就变成了the dead (people)
		the Titanic (ship) 泰坦尼特号
		the Hilton (hotel) 希尔顿酒店
	骗局1:为什么the USA 和 China一个要加the一个不用
		the united states of America
		因为the是限定states
	骗局2:the+abj等于一类人
		the rich,the young,the poor
		因为他是省略了people
	最大的骗局: 为什么sun moon 只有一个却要加the
		the sun [恒星]
		the moon [行星]
		the earth [土地]
		
lesson 3 不定式(to+v)和语气助动词
	助动词分为 语法助动词(be do have) 语气助动词(情态动词)(can could should may might)
		i do it.i can do it. i may do it. i might do it.表达一种情感
	语气助动词 = 不定式放在宾语前 can等于to able to
		i am(be动词->系动词) glad to see you => i am glad [because i can see you] 原因状语从句
		i am glad 本身就是一个主谓补(主系表)结构 所以后面的词都是修饰成分 这些都是(副词)状语从句
		i am glad 和 后面的because i can see you 有重复而英语的两大原则简洁 精确 -> i am glad because i am able to see you -> i am glad to see you.
		所以说所有的不定式to+v都是语气助动词的简化
	can => be able to => to 不定式和语气助动词 都表达了一定的不确定性
		i will go. i want to go
		he may be right.he seems to be right
		it is raining now. 
		修饰一定语气助动词表示现在 it must be raining now. 
		可能会下雪语气助动词表示将来 it might snow. 
		it rained last night. 
		情态动词后面要加动词原型而be表示被动只能加构成完成时的have it must have rained last night. => it seems to have rained last night
	must -> have to
	should -> ought to
	will/would -> be going to
	can/could -> be able to
	may/might -> be likely to 
	非谓语动词(verbals)[不定式,动名词,现在分词,过去分词]其实就是不做谓语的动词变成了这些奇怪的状态
		动名词是n. 现在分词 过去分词是abj.
		而不定式做补语可能做n. 而和动名词要根据谓语来选择
		to do or doing?
		主谓宾s+v+o 宾语可能用不定式也可能用动名词 不带有任何不确定性推测性完成式时就用动名词 而不定式有助动词的属性(推测语气)
			1.plan to do
				they plan /*that they will(be going to)*/ marry next month => they plan to marry next month
			2.avoid doing 你要避免的是你已经犯的错
				 i avoid making the same mistake twice. 如果改成to do 就变成了 will make the mistake 表示将来可我已经犯了错明显是错误的
			3.hate to say 讨厌去说 但我还要说一次
				i hate to say this,but i think you are ulgy. i have to say this,...
			4.try to do没有做过所以是准备尽力去做 try doing已经做过的所以就是尝试去做
				i always try to be on time. 我已经尽力准时了 -> i always try if i can be on time 
				why dont you try being late? 你为什么不尝试去迟到	
			5.remember to do remember doing	
				please remember to call me tomorrow. -> please remember that you must call me tomorrow.
				i remember calling her last night.
			6.stop
				he stopped talking at the meeting.
				he stopped to drink water. -> he stoped so that he could drink water.
	使役动词(没有选择余地的词let make have)+动词原形
		the little girl asked her mother to come to the meeting -> the little girl asked if her mother be going to the meeting.不是使役动词
		the teacher make the boy stand.这里make是使役动词
		the teacher ask the boy to stand
	感官动词(feel,see...)
		weni see her playing the violin. 因为小提琴本身就是持续的动作 所以要加ing
		i see her to play the violin-> i see that he will play 我看到她将要弹琴 明显是不对的 我无法看到之后的动作
		i heard her cry(crying) in pain. 加了cry就是她哭了一声 而crying就是一直哭 但不能用to do因为无法看到之后的动作


lesson 4 动名词(v+ing)
	非谓语动词(verbals)[不定式,动名词,现在分词,过去分词] 动名词是n. 现在分词 过去分词是abj.
		let me buy you a drink. drinking is his hobby. ing不仅有现在进行的意思还有长期的意思
		i am not afraid of death but afraid of dying. 我不畏惧死亡但我害怕这个过程 所以用dying(v+ing)
	v+ing=N
		i like swimming.
		it`s time for a swim.
	可数的动名词 wedding婚礼 由wed娶变来
	动名词和现在分词 v+ing=n. v+ing=abj. 放到补语位置如果能通顺就是形容词
		the flying bird is beautiful. abj. 这个flying代表的是一种动作把 beautiful去掉就变成了 the bird is flying(现在时这其实是主谓补)
		the flying jacket is cool. n.	the jacket is for flying.这个夹克是用来飞的
	动名词是一种很好的表达
		The climbing of mountains is fun.这句话写的非常烂
		Climbing mountains is fun. => That anyone climbs mountains is fun. => mountain-climbing is fun. 名词代替形容词不能加复数
		i pick strawberries => strawberry picking
	名词代替形容词不能加复数
		a tree year old boy 这个结构是放在形容词性质的所以year不加s
	例子
		i enjoy that i teach english 宾语从句 -> i enjoy teaching english.
	abj.这里可以放所有格
		i dont like that Zed kills Teemo everyday. that可以省略 -> i dont like killing Teemo everyday但这里缺少了Zed不符合含义->i dont like Zed`s killing Teemo everyday
	动名词的被动态 (being+v.的ed形式)
		That i was invited is a great honor. -> being invited is a great honor. be没有任何含义 而ing本身有做过的意思


lesson 5 分词 现在分词-ing 过去分词-ed其实是形容词
	非谓语动词(verbals) 不定式:to + v 动名词:v+ing 现在分词:-ing 过去分词:-ed
	-ful是一个abj词根意思为满useful -lessabj词根意思为少useless
	-ing=正在,持续 -ed=已经被,完成
	形容词只能放在名词前和补语位置
	现在分词做形容词 过去分词和 现在 可转换成主系表的
		That black dog doesn`t bite.
		The barking dog doesn`t bite. barking是abj. 如果能放到补语位置就是形容词(现在分词) the dog is barking.
	过去分词做形容词
		clean water is safe to drink. svc+状语 -> clean wate is safe because everyone can drink
		Boiled water is safe to drink. boiled是过去分词的形容词
		the water is clean. the water is boiled. is boiled大多数人都说是被动形态但boiled是abj.
		This is a good book.->the book is good;
		This is a well-selling book. -> the book is selling well.传统语法认为这是is selling是一起的正在卖的 但黑科技要分开看成主系表selling是abj.
		This is a well-written book. -> the book is written well.传统语法认为这是is written是一起的写完的 但黑科技要分开 看成主系表 written是abj.
	传统语法中 be + doing = 现在进行时.但有很多矛盾比如The movie is boring. 这个电影现在很无聊明显说不清 直接看成主系表结构
	传统语法中 be + done = 被动语态. the water is boiled. ed可以直接理解成被动词根
		i can`t find my bag,it is gone! 如果用被动态 it is gone.它被丢了明显不对 gone表达的是it的状态
		The leaves are fallen. 树叶被落了明显不对 done结构除了被动意思还要一种完成的状态
		I am done. 我做完了.
	感觉类的词很难区分 过去分词 和现在分词
		basketball is interesting.
		He is interested in basketball. =>Basketball interests him!
		I have nothing to say while the case is being investigated by police. =>I have nothing that i must say
		the case is being investigated by police. being be没有含义ing表正在 investigate+ed 被调查

lesson 6 形容词(无定语从句)
		Cool zed kills poor Teemo solely.
	1. 限定 abj. n. 名词短语中的形容词 被称为属性abj. attributive abject
		a big tree 	a small garden 	many popular songs	my dearest friend abj.只有比较级和最高级
		同样的位置可以放名词 an apple tree 	that flower shop 	a shoe factory 名词作形容词没有复数 a three-year-old boy  a hard-to-solve problem 复合形容词
		the savings bank 形容词这有s因为saving这个词本身就有意思为节约 several clothes hangers 一些衣服架 因为cloth本身就有意思为布料 your sports car sports本身就是形容词
		形容词的顺序 概念更相似更放的离名词更近 (名词本体约相近放越后 难以改变的放越后)
			1.three big red apples
			2.three red big apples
			he graduated from a prestigious old American law school.
			i throw away that dirty old blue silk necktie
	也有例外形容词放名词后面 实际上someone = some+one 它的abj.本身应该在some one 中间但是过于亲密就只能放后方 这叫修辞
		I am meeting someone important tonight.传统英语中是不定代词的后置定语
		I don`t know anyone else.
	英语中有很多a开头的abj alike asleep 这里a在古语中等于on所以这里alike是一个介词只能放后面
		jane and her mother alike are teachers 这里形容词放在词组后面
	英语中的很多外来词也不遵守语法结构
		the president elect 当选的总谈
		Asia minor 小亚细亚
		secretary general 秘书总管
	2. svc主谓补(主系表) 叙述abj.
		The tree is big.
		mr wang is a busy man. 属性abj.
		the man is busy today	叙述abj. 描述abj.
		these flowers are sweet
		the boss kept us busy 主谓宾补(we are busy)
		I saw the dog crossing the street 主谓宾补(the dog is crossing the street)
		The patient is asleep.a=-ing
		I am eager to begin the project. to begin the project是状语 I am eager because I have to begin the project.
	比较级最高级什么时候+er est + more most
		tall taller tallest 单音节原音)的+er est
		多音节原音)的 important + more most
		两个音节(原音)crowed loving 都加more most 因为都是形容词词尾 less ful ous ing ed
		often加不加more都行
	最高级前要加the=>比较级前不加the 是正确的吗
		Most books in my room are new.这里的most是many变来的这一次它是限定词
		Mangoes are most expensive in early summer.这里没有名词成分也不能加the 加the也行因为用的人太多了
		Do you have a cheaper room?
		I`ll take the cheaper one. the出现和名词有关和比较级没任何关系


lesson 7  副词adverb
	 1.方式状态adv. 只修饰动词 一般只放动词前和只修饰一个词时放整体结构后面
	 	1)s+v
	 		The dog barked loudly at the man. 也可以放barked前 因为修饰对象不变
	 	2)s+v+c 主系表
	 		He stayed single unwillingly. 也可以放stayed前 因为修饰对象不变 但不能放在single前因为这样就会导致副词修饰single和stayed的情况
	 	3)s+v+o
	 		He hit the boy openly. 也可以放hit前
	 		He openly hit the boy sitting on the counter. 不能放在句尾只能放在hit前因为这样就修饰了hit和sitting了
	 	4)s+v+o+o
	 		his father bought him a car generously. 也可以放在bought前
	 	5)s+v+o+c
	 		I happily pronounce you man and wife. 只能放前面因为语气问题大家都想man and wife
	 2.频度副词(always, usually,often,never) 突然翻车不是黑科技按照网上写的
	 	通常放在动词前 助动词后
	 		we often get together
	 		Jane usually goes to work by bike
	 	如果有两个助动词通常放在第一个后面
	 		We have never been invited to one of their parties
	 	当表示强调时和当助动词放在句末的时候 放在助动词之前
	 		I never can remember. 表示强调
	 		Can you park your car near the shop? yes.l usually can. 助动词放在句末
	 3.强调范围的abv. 限定范围的abv.可以修饰四种词(n. v. abj. abv.) (over even especially only)
	 	Only John saw his boss yesterday.这里的only是副词可它限定的是john
	 	John Only saw his boss yesterday.修饰就变了强调saw
	 	John saw Only his boss yesterday.这里又修饰了boss
	 	John saw his boss Only yesterday.修饰就变了强调yesterday 约翰到昨天才见到了老板
	 	I like Chinese food especially toast duck. especially abv.
	 4.加强语气abv. 也可以修饰四种词(n. v. abj. abv.) 
	 	You are absolutely a genius.你绝壁是天才 修饰的是genius
	 	The test is extremely difficult.
	 5.程度adv. 非常重要的副词去掉了影响意思(almost nearly )
	 	The plan almost failed.
	 6.修饰句子的abv.
		 连接abv. 
		 	Damage has increased 20% beside,mana cost has come dowm. beside为连接副词后面需要加,
		 	She is great.He, however, is bad.Therefore, the film is not perfect.
		 分离abv.(generally， honestly)
		 	theoretically, you idea might work. 理论上,你的想法可以执行(theoretically 他本身就是一个句子)
		 	theoretically speaking.理论上说 If we are speaking theoretically.
	举例 practically 是几乎地 实际上地
			You demand is practically impossible to meet. 修饰的是impossible(程度abv.)
			Let`s discuss this problem practically.	修饰的是discuss
			Practically, you can`t win the game. 修饰句子的分离abv.
		firm/firmly 坚定的;牢固的
			You should hold it firmly.
			Hold the camera firm while you take the picture. firm这里是补语(the camera is firm)
			The ememy is advancing.stand firm. you stand firm.
		clean/cleanly
			The man wiped the window clean. 主谓宾补
			He dresses cleanly.	主谓

lesson 8  动词时态
	时态一共有24种加上传统语法的过去将来一共32种
	而我们分成两种 一般时 be和完成时 have been 首先所有的分词都看成形容词 把一些时态变成静态动词
	静态动词没有进行时
		He is eating breakfast 这里eat表达动作
		I am busy. am并没有表达动作所以是静态动词
		I have a lot work to do. have没有动作所以是静态动词
	根据意思来归类静态和动态
		I was being nice.
		I was having lunch. 这里的being是表现 having是吃 所以不是静态动词
	时态分为两种一种是一般时 be 第二种是完成时 have been
		一般时 be (一般式是一个时间范围)
		1.过去
				the US declared Indepence in 1776.
			被动 过去分词
				The dyrmite was invented(abj.) by the Chinese. 这里直接看成主系表invented看成过去分词 abj.
			过去进行 现在分词
				I was visiting him the whole day yesterday. 我昨天在他家一整天. 依然是主系表 现在分词 abj.
			过去 进行 被动
				The house was being renovated when it collapsed on the worker. 这个房子正在被翻新的时候倒塌在了工人身上
		2.现在 以now为圆心划括号括号有无限大 传统语法中事实真理都要用现在时
			I have a headache.
			Our house is located on the lake. 被安置的 传统语法所谓的一般现在时的被动态
			Everyone is sleeping now. 
			This road is closed now becase it is being widened. 传统语法所谓的现在进行时的被动态
		3.将来 根本没有将来时 只有将来时间的表达方法比如be going to,will,would like
			John will leave tomorrow.临时产生的事情 => John is going leave tomorrow.  有计划性的事情 是begoingto的省略结构
			=> John is to leave tomorrow. is to代表的是正式文体 比如报刊里因为报刊要求简短 也是begoingto的省略结构
			=> John is leaving tomorrow. 也是begoingto的省略结构
			=> John will be leaving tomorrow. will情态动词接动词原型 be leaving 现在进行时 be在英语中就是随便拿来凑的
			=> John leaves tomorrow. 传统语法中的现在表将来 其实是将来确定不变的事情
			The train leaves at 2:30.  将来确定不变的事情
			都有细微差别 但表达方式那么多所以真的没有这个时态
			还有一个所谓的过去将来时 其实根本就不要时间来理解这里其实是虚拟语句所以后下个lesson虚拟语气再写
		4.完成时(have been)
			I have seem the movie.
			Everything has been done, now we can only wait and see. 有时间副词now所以有已经完成的事情
			Those runners have been running for two whole hours now.
			I have lived here for 20 years.
			I have been living here for 20 years. 这两句意思其实差不多只是强调不同第一句可能搬到其他地方住过总共加起来20年第二句表达从未离开
			I have read your book。
			I have been reading you book. 这两句有区别因为第二句是正在读完你的书也就是还没读完 (所以一切从句子意思出发 所以英语一定要简洁精准)
			By august I will have worked at the company for 30 years.
			By august I will have been working at the company for 30 years. 其实没什么区别
			He says that our job will have been done by the middle of the century.

lesson 9 语气
	传统语气中一共三种 1.叙述语气 2.虚拟语气 3.祈使语气 而我们加一个条件语气
	1.叙述语气 就是普通的句子
		I chose zed as my hero.
		Zed killed teemo yesterday.
		Zed has joint the LOL for 4 year.
		I will go to korean next week.
		还有很多 I am going to go... I am to go... I am going... 也可以直接用go一般现在时表示将来时间
		传统语法中 主将从现 条件状语从句中主用将来 从用现在 但今天要颠覆
		If his story is true, i will help him. 我们假定要发生 但时间逻辑上是有关系的 如果我要用将来时那么从句已经发生了
		I will be ready, when he comes. 我们假定他来了 我将准备好
	2.条件语气 加了语气助动词的句子 真假不确定的句子
		you are right.	确定语气
		you may be right. 不确定语气就是条件语气
	3.虚拟语气 说反话 分为现在过去将来 虚拟语气不能用can will和may 要变could would 和might
		现在 虚拟语气的主从不能一起看
			If I were you,I would not do it. 这里用were古代英语中was可以用 而were更加像假话所以用were 而这里will变成了would因为也在说假话我不是你我也不知道我要做什么
		过去 过去的事情已经发生了所以用过去的过去
			If i had known earlier, I might have done something. 
			过去的事情已经发生了所以用过去的过去 所以用过去完成 而这里用might是根据意思来的其实不是虚拟语气
			It might have rained last night
			The accident happened because the driver was not careful. 变成虚拟语气就要说反话
			=> the accident could have been prevented if the driver had been more careful. 从句过去式变成过去的过去 因为是虚拟主句要加个情态动词could 中间过去式往后的推理 情态动词后加动词原型have been
		将来 语法中没有将来时
			The weatherman say it will rain tommorrow. 正常情况下将来是没有虚拟的 但特定条件下有虚拟的感觉
			If I were to tell the truth to my father ,he would kill me! 从句是虚拟语气因为你不会告诉你爸 were to 在语法书中本来就是对将来做虚拟的其实是由be going to变来 be to go.主句也是虚拟语气因为不会真的杀了你
			If an asteroid should hit the Earth,man could die out. 可能撞 人可能就死
			should hit/can die  可能撞 人就死(这里就错了can不是虚拟语气)
			were to hit/could die 一定撞 人可能就死
			were to hit/can die 
			这里四个意思都不一样 如果小行星撞地球是100%可能的用were to 如果可能撞那就用should 虚拟语气不能用can will和may were to是基本上确定
			一定要根据意思出发
		If I had studied harder at school I could qualify for the job now. 加了now所以前后时间不一致
		I could have contributed to the fund, only that I didnt have any money. 因为是过去发生过的事情而I had contribute是代表事实 而我是可能捐所以加could 后面是叙述句
	4.祈使语气 命令语气
		Watch your step!
		You may come in!
		come in!
		间接祈使句 传统语法中的be形虚拟
			It is necessary that the letter be sent out before noon. 这个be祈使句 主语是you 命令语气
			I insist(suggest/demand) that the letter be/should be/was sent out before noon. 三个意思都不一样 be-命令语气 was-过去式叙事语气 should be-寄信的选择权在你

lesson 10 介词(介系词,介副词) preposition
	介词实际独立于语法 介词一般都是修饰成分放在名词前面(at in on...)
	介词能修饰大多数词除了is系动词
		he company is in trouble. 主谓补 in trouble是形容词性短语
		I leave for korean tomorrow. 主谓 传统语法中不及物动词接东西要加副词 其实这就是主谓结构for korean介词短语修饰的是方向  修饰动词
		The box is full of chocolate. 主谓补 这里强调的是怎么样满 传统语法中用full of something做固定 但这里明明就是随便的 修饰形容词
		He`ll return tomorrow at the least. 主谓 tomorrow是时间副词 at least 最后最晚 介词短语修饰副词
	介副词 后面不跟词和副词一样的介词
		come in. 祈使语气
		stand up. 这里in和up是介副词 因为这些都是副词形式 in修饰come up修饰stand
		He went down to the basement. 这里的down就是介副词 to the basement是介词词组也是副词成分
		The man slept on the couch. 睡在沙发上 on the couch是介词短语
		The man turned on the light. 两句话结构明显不一样 这个是svc结构 这个是固定搭配短语动词所以短语动词最难的就像中文的葡萄匍匐一定要被词组
	词组动词 英语中最难 只能嗯背 不是语法是词法
		短语动词pv分为及物和不及物 及物分为可拆 不可拆
			come about 发生 不及物短语动词: how did this come about? 
			fall off 衰退:Business has fallen off badly since 2018.
			get over 不可拆 康复:You`ll get over it soon. 如果变成get it over就变成了趁早了结
			take after 不可拆 像: He takes after his father.
			look after 照顾
		同一个词组有两个意思及物不及物来区分
			stand by 支持:I`ll stand by you. 
			stand by 准备:please stand by.
		可拆(很多都是历史遗留问题 德语动词就能分开)
			bring up 抚养-> that woman brought up 8 childen.
			that woman brought 8 childen up.
			that woman brought them up.
			make up 有很多意思编造 化妆 制造 和好->He made up a story
			He made a story up
			He made it up
			He and his wife made up 这里made up是和好
		三个词以上的动词词组
			catch up with 追上
			drop out of 退出 退学
			get away with 全身而退 侥幸逃脱
	空间介词(很难) 点at 线on,along 面on 体in
		The bus will stop at the station.每一个站台在车站上是一个点所以用at
		The student sang a song on his way to school. on是一条线
		I see three stores on the street. 街道是线性的东西
		There`s a picture on the wall. 墙是面
		I like to stay in my house. 房子是个体积
		There are many cars in the street. 如果我用in那马路就是个空间你在马路中能用 而on就是平面你可能是高处俯瞰 其实都对
		on one`s way/in one`s way.
		He is on his way to korea. step aside!you are in my way.第一句这条路是一条路线. 第二句你挡到我了路这条路是立体空间
	时间介词 at表示几点钟 in一段时间 on具体某天
	arrive in/arrive at 一般老师都说大的用in 小的用at 但是是错的
		We`ll arrive at korea in 5 minutes where we`ll transfer before flying on to the china. 因为这里韩国就是一个转接点所以用at
	The hero arrive in town an was greated by the crowd。因为这个是具体的地方是立体的所以是in
		made of/made from  一般老师都说of是物理 from是化学 但是是错的
	These shoes were mode from rubber tires. 这里轮胎鞋子明显是物理变化.而我们不知道它之前是轮胎 of能看出是什么做的form不能看出来 of:是...的的意思 form:从...而来的意思
		a chair made of wood.
		wine made form grapes
	between/among 突然翻车了我只能自己补上我通过grammarly官网查的
		anhui lies between henan and jiangsu between事实上，您可以对任意数量的元素使用between，只要所有元素都是独立且不同的 
		当包含的对象没有很多区别且被视为一个群体时用among
		Negotiations between the member states collapsed last night. 昨晚在谈判在成员国之间崩溃了

lesson 11 主谓一致
	have还是has？ 加s还是不加? are还是is am?
	your brother John has come to see you. 主语是your brother和John两者都是一个人 传统语法的同谓语
	your brother John have come to see you. your brother和John两者是两个人
	The senator and delegate wants to make a speech. 名词=限定+abj.+n the是限定 [senator and delegate] delegate前没有限定词是一个人即是参议员和代表
	Every man and every woman has to do sth. for the  country. 用has 这里的every的作用是强调 其实every man和every woman 等于every person
	All work and no play makes jack a dull boy. 谚语 用makes是因为天天工作和不玩是一件事情的正反两面所以是单数
	A cup and saucer is placed on the table. saucer没有定冠词 A cup and saucer茶杯和茶垫是一个整体
	Bread and butter is very filling. 用is 两者没有限定词 面包和黄油非常饱饱 因为正常人不会吃黄油吃饱 所以其实是合在一起的
	Bread and butter have both risen in price. 都涨价了 这两个都是单独的词
	You want to borrow money? But I, as well as you, am broke.  as well as you只是为了强调 原句还是I am broke as well as you.
	I, no less than you, am responsible.我不亚于你 原句是 I am responsible no less than you are responsible.
	No only you but also I am at fault. 不只是你我也犯过错 重点在but also后面是全新的句子
	either his or both his parents are coming. 前面是单后面是双 and连接在一起两个加一起是复数 but忽略前面只管后面 而or和nor只能跟谁进跟谁走

	Ten seconds is a record for the 100-meter dash. 时间是一个整体
	The use of computers in business is now almost inevitable. use才是主语
	All of these are chinese pears. all才是主语当all和some none a little是主语时英语中是个空洞的概念不嫩表示什么 必须看后面的介词短语部分来判断单复数
	All of the money has been spent.
	All but one of the pears are ripe. but表示除了那一个 all才是主语 还是根据of the pears
	None of the pears is(are) really good to eat. is are 都对跟着 none =no one那么就是没有意义的数就是is 但随着时代变迁有人把none看成一个整体要跟着后面的意义所以都对
	The committee are studying the proposal. 这里用are是因为comittee是集合名词 本身就有单数复数的意思如果代表委员成员那就是复数整个委员会就是单数
	集合n. staff committee family faculty...
	The committee is five years old.

lesson 12 名词从句 上
	英语句子分为 简单句:lesson1的五种 复合句:and,but,or..连接的简单句 复杂句-简单句作一个成分,简单句嵌套简单句
		I saw Teemo. + Teemo was killed. = I saw that Teemo was killed. 宾语从句这个that没有意思只有语法功能 that可以省略
	名词从句分两种 陈述句改造:句前+that 疑问句改造:1.特殊疑问句(信息疑问句)wh-(when,where,who..) 一般疑问句(yes no疑问句)
	陈述句改造:被替换的位置加that和从句
		He didn`t take the money. + I believe that. => I believe that he didn`t take the money. 这里that直接删掉了加上引导词that再加后面的句子
	特殊疑问句:先变成陈述句再替换位置
		What happened at his party?(主谓 + 地点状语) + I never asked him the question.(主谓双宾) => I never asked him what happened at his party
		把第一句整句拿下来把question去掉
	一般疑问句:whether/if + 从句
		Where did he keep the money?(where地点副词did是助动词产生疑问	+主谓宾) + He never answered the quesiton.(主谓宾) => He never answered where he kept the money. did拿掉还原正常语序陈述句 主句和从句时态要一致
		Is it going to rain? + I can tell(判断) the question => 第一句因为直接变成陈述句意思就变了所以要先要变成 either it is going to rain or not.如何将either变为 whether? whether = which either 这里也可以加 if 因为whether和if都代表是否但if还有如果的意思 I can tell weither it is going to rain (or not).
	whether(是否) vs if(如果,是否)
		Whether we can win the game will be decided soon. 这里不能用if 因为if如果放在前面会产生歧义
		The boss hinted at whether he would sign the contract. 介词后只能用whether
	名词的位置 1.名词位置 主语 宾语 补语 同位语 介词后宾语
		1.主语位置
			something is true. + zed is cool. =>  [That zed is cool] is ture. 主谓宾 主语从句的that不能省略因为这样就默认主语从句是主句了
			something is true. + zed is cool. => It is true that Zed is cool. 传统的形式主语 整个句子如果头重脚请把整个主语部分的从句用it代替拿到后
			Where is he hiding now? 主系表 + The question is a big mystery. 主系表 => where he is hiding now is a big mystery. = It is big mystery where he is hiding now.
		2.宾语位置
			Many people believe something. + Zed can kill Teemo. => Many people believe that Zed can kill Teemo. 这里that可以省略 因为默认第一句就是主语
			I find something amazing. 主谓宾补 + You still look so young. 主系表 => I find that you still look so young amazing. 这里that可以省略

lesson 13 名词从句 下
	上歌lesson中 名词从句分两种 陈述句改造:句前+that 疑问句改造:1.特殊疑问句(信息疑问句)wh-(when,where,who..) 一般疑问句(yes no疑问句)
	名词的位置 1.名词位置 主语 宾语 表语 同位语 介词后宾语
	3.补(表)语位置
		It seems something + we`re going to win the game. => It seems that we`re going to win the game. 这里that可以省略
		The question is this. + can we do anything about it? => The question is whether we can do anything about it.
	4.同位语位置 一个名词后面加另一个名词他们还是一个东西之后会细讲	I, teacher Yu,am a man 名词+名词从句
		Yasuo remebered the fact. + that zed killed teemo. => Yasuo remebered the fact that zed killed teemo.
		The student is worried + that he may fail in the exam => The student is worried (about the possibility) that he may fail in the exam. 						这是一个形容词可同位语是名词+名词从句 其实他是一个省略句省略了(worried about the possibility)possibility是名词 
		The man was unaware + That a thief had stolen his money. => The man was unaware (of the fact) that a thief had stolen his money.
			worried about,unaware of一般都这样用 作为固定搭配 这里涉及到同位语之后才有这样的内容
		I am sure (of the question) what caused the problem.
	5.介词后宾语 on+n. 
	加在介词后名词变成同位语从句 或 介词后能直接接由疑问词引导(what,who,if...)的从句
	不能在介词后加that因为之前in that,but that,except,save,besides,beyond是能和that搭配的但是时间久了之后就成了固定词组就不习惯跟
		My response depends on the question. + what did he mean? = My response depends on what he meant.
		His response depends on the fact. + i owe him a favor. = His response depend on the fact that i owe him a favor. on the fact不能拿掉因为depend是不及物动词
	The man said "the road is closed" => The man said that the road was closed
	1.The man said "the road is closed" 2."the road is closed" The man said  3.the road is closed, said the man  4.the road is closed, The man said 
	都是对的 1.2.是强调说的话 是名词从句放大 再说人4同理 3.said和man对调是一种倒装是一种修辞

lesson 14 状语从句 adverbia clause (副词adverb从句)
	状语从句=连接词(because, as, if)+陈述句 状语从句主要放在句子前后去掉不影响整体含义
		I believe that zed is a ninja. 主谓宾 宾语从句
		I believe that because I have seem him. 主谓宾后加了个because引导的整个原因状语从句
		Zed said sincerely that he was sorry. 主谓宾 宾语从句
		Zed said it so sincerely that Teemo forgave him. so用来修饰sincere 主谓宾+so..that状语从句连接词,副词的引导词+ 结果状语从句
		Where is Teemo hiding? => where Teemo is hiding is anyone`s guess.  is anyone`s guess-没人猜到
		变成状语从句要先加no matter无论 => No matter where teemo is hiding zed is going to find him. 无论提莫藏在哪里劫都将找到他.No matter where有时可以改写成wherever
	状从分为 陈述句改造:连接词+从句 特殊疑问句改造:no matter + wh(what,where) + 从句 或 wh..ever(wherever,whatever)+从句  一般疑问句改造: whether 或 no matter+从句
		Is Teemo still alive? => whether Teemo is still alive or not is hard to say. 变为主语从句
		变成状语从句 要去掉后面主语改为  whether Teemo is still alive or not zed is going to find him. 从句不做句子中成分才能变成状语从句 这是条件状语从句 whether 也可以改为no matter 
	判断状语条件成分对于阅读非常重要分类也非常难(让步 原因 时间 地点 目的 条件 结果 限制(程度,范围) 方式)
		He became happier after he got married. 主系表 
			不影响意思所以是状语或者定语 而after是副词连接词 所以是副词从句 这里是因为是结婚后所以是副词从句
			如果吧after 换成because就变成原因状语了
		I`ll be waiting for you until you`re married.
			这是时间状语从句
		As there is little time left we`d better hurry. 
			只有很少的时间留下来了我们最好快一点 这里as是因为所以是原因状语从句
		There`s noting to worry about，now that he is back 
			这里是状语从句用了 now that连接也是也是一个连词 意为既然 这里是now that在英语中是原因状语从句
		He looked so sincere that no one doubted his story. 
			结果状语从句 so用来修饰sincere
		The mother locked the door from the outside, so that the kids couldn`t get out when they saw fire.	
			The mother locked the door 是主语 so that是连接词意思为所以结果状语 the kids couldn`t get out when they saw fire when引导时间状语从句
		The mother locked away the knives so that the kids wouldn`t hurt themsleves. 这里so that表示目的 目的状语从句
		I`ve sent you my photos lest you forget me. 
			lest意思为以免 目的状语从句
		Although you may disagree I will try. 让步状语从句
		While the disease is no fatal,it can be very dangerous. 
			这里while是尽管的意思 让步状语从句
		As far as money is concerned,you needn`t worry. 
			as far as这里意思为就 就钱而言,你不用担心 程度(限制)状语从句 限制了主句的范围
		He was a different hero in that he broke all traditions. 
			in that that本身不能直接在介词后面但 in that是固定词组 in that的原型是 in the sense that 在某种情况下意思也能为即 限制状语从句
		He played Gragas as PDD did. as这里是像 是方式状语从句
		He writes as if he is left handed. 这里as if是好像 所以是方式状语
		He writes as if he were left handed. 这里were是虚拟语气 as if也是好像
		He writes as if he was left handed.

lesson 15 定语从句上(关系从句)
	定语从句全程叫限定性从句 两句话之间有关系所以联系在一起 并且把有关联的重复部分(先行词)变为关系代词放在主语关联后面 
		I know sth. + Nobody else knows it = which I know sth. which nobody else knows. 
			这两句话sth.是重复的 第一句的sth等于第二句的it 这里it就要改造成这里只是修饰了sth.
		I know that i am right. 宾语从句
		I know this because I have proof. 原因状语从句
		I don`t trust people who talk too much. 这里是定语从句 后面从句的people变成了问候
		Zed can kill Teemo + He is a ninja => 	zed who/that is ninja can kill Teeemo. 
			he Zed是重复的 所以要变成who 这里who还可以that 因为that简化成分为the 而that有指代作用后面 的关系从句只要明确表达前面的先行词 那么都可以替换成that 这里that/who无法省略 因为两个谓语动词中间也没有主语所以不能
		Zed is a ninja + I love the ninja very much =>  Zed is a ninja who/whom/that(可以省略) I love very much.  
			重复部分明显是ninjia 这里the ninjia 要改成whom 因为是宾语位置所以关系代词用whom 这里也可以换成who 也不用换句形 因为他变到了前面脱离了宾语位置 也可以换that因为这里有指示作用(把前面的词限定了范围) 也可以全部省略意思可以通没有歧义
		Zed is ninjia. + You should talk to him => Zed is ninjia whom/who/that(可以省略) you should talk to.to him 
			这里是介宾 这里zed和him明显是有关联 而我们要求用ninja连接 而这里who也可以替换whom和上题原因一样 也可以用that 因为和之前意思一样 也可以省略
		After the patch, Zed is not the ninjia + He used to be the ninja => After the patch, Zed is not the ninja who/that(可以) he used to be. 
			重复的部分是ninja 放在补(表)语位置的名词不可以用whom
		Zed is a ninjia + I trust his judgment. => Zed is a ninja whose judgment I trust. 
			ninja和his重复 而his变成关系代词要用whose 要把整个所属格搬过去
	先行词换成物(一般关系代词做主语时that不能省略)
		I like movies + The movies make he think主谓宾补 => I like movies which/that make me think. 这里可以用which
		The movie was great + I saw the movie last night => The movie which/that(可以省略) I saw last night was great.
		That chair is boken + You are sitting on that chair. => That chair which/that(可以省略) you are sitting on is boken.
			也可以改成on which 后面去掉on 如果on走了就不能变成that了
		The name is strange + He calls the dog the name. svoo => The name which/that(可以省略) He calls the dog is strange.
		1 I saw a mountain.
		2 Its top was covered in snow.
		3 The top of the mountain was covered in snow.
			1+2 => I saw a mountain whose is top was covered in snow.这里its要换成 whose因为which没有所属格 只能用whose
			1+3 => I saw a mountain of which the top was coverd in snow. 这里of which不能分开因为要体现所有格
			He can marry any girl. + He like that. => He can marry any girl which/that he like. 这里that指代人但这里要用which 这里的which是选择任何一个这里的 是一个限定符

lesson 16 定语从句中(关系从句)
	句子分析
		The house was overrun with ants,which was strange. 
			这里是定语从句 而先行词在意思上来说这些蚂蚁很奇怪 者房子很奇怪都可以 因为这里用的是was所以代的是house 所以这句话很不好 最好把which从句放在 the house后面 但是如果这样改就变成了这房子本身就很奇怪 被蚂蚁爬满了 而不是因为蚂蚁爬满了才奇怪 如果后面的was改为were那就指代ants
		The house was overrun with ants, which frightened Teemo. 
			这里frightened是使teemo害怕 这里明显无法根据后面的动词判断先行词 所以不够精确. 如果在which前加 a sight 作为前面整个句子的同位语 或者 在which前加 crowded insects 在中间加,传统语法中是非限制性定语从句
		I met a friend who/that went to school with me.
		I met a JackWang, who went to school with me.
			第一句话可以替换that因为限定了那个朋友 第二句不可以替换成that 因为这个jack wang本身就是专有名词后面的话其实是补充说明的成分所以不能用 that是具有指代作用的 非限制性定语从句不能用that做关系代词 如果把第二句后面,去掉那么从句必须是更加有意义的句子不然不能用that
	定语从句就是把一句话作为abj.的作用,所以形容词(定语从句,关系从句)都是一个东西
	属性abj.这个形容词和修饰对象关系很硬不能分开就是限制性定语从句 比如 apple tree
	描述abj.说明这个词关系不硬就是非限制性定语从句 the tree is big.
		I met a friend, quite by chance,who/that went to the same high school with me.
			这个地方的先行词是friend 这里可以替换that 因为这里 后面的句子限定了friend 而这里的,其实是为了quite by chance意为碰巧的是完全可以去掉不影响意思的
		Thirty minutes is all the time that I can spare. 30分钟是我所有可以花的时间了
		You are the only person that really understands me.
			这两句只能用that 因为that是有指代用作的 如果这句话存在强烈指定作用的词(all, only, anything,日期...)把范围限定死了 那就只能用that
		My friend Zed,who/whom(可以省略) you met yesterday,is a ningja.
